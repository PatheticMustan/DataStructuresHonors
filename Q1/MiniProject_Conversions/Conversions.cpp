/** Conversions.cpp, by Kevin Wang
 * 
 * Complete the following functions with the given declarations. All user input and output must occur in your
 * main function. You are permitted to create other functions if you feel they would help you complete the task.
 * Call your C++ file Conversions.
 * 
 * This is to be submitted to Classroom by the date on the assignment. You are only completing one file for this mini-project.
 * In your main function, you are going to be invoking the following functions. Obtain test values from the user
 * through the cin command. Your program must contain enough input to properly invoke the following
 * functions. The declarations are below:
 * 
 * string toBase(int decimal, int base)
 *      Converts the argument integer from base 10 to the argument base (base <= 9).
 * string toBase16(int decimal)
 *      Converts the argument integer from base 10 to base 16.
 * int toInteger(string number, int base)
 *      Converts the argument string from the argument base to base 10 (base <= 9).
 * int toInteger16(string number)
 *      Converts the argument string from base 16 to base 10.
 * 
 * This project will be graded on:
 * 1. Documentation (4 points): Your code must be fully commented and employ standard C++-style
 *      conventions.
 * 2. User-Friendliness (4 points): All interactions with the user must be clear and unambiguous.
 * 3. Functions (16 points): Each function has the proper declaration and works as expected.
 * TOTAL: 24 points
